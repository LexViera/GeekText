3. If the backend is running correctly and compiled without errors the page `http://localhost:8888/test` should display some text on the browser. The # counter should also increment on page reload
4. Application has been deployed and can be tested at `https://geek-text-g15.herokuapp.com/test`. No need to run code in your machine.
